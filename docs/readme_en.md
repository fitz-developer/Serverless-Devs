# Project expectations

- Serverless Devs hopes to provide serverless developers with a serverless developer tool that can play a role in the entire life cycle of serverless applications without vendor lock-in;
- Serverless Registry hopes to provide a complete set of package management specifications for the serverless ecosystem, similar to pypi in Python, npm in Nodejs, etc., and will use this to open and share serverless packages and build a serverless ecosystem;
- The Serverless Developer Meetup hopes to create a community event that is most in line with Serverless developers. Through this event, we hope that more people can communicate with us and learn about Serverless-related products;
