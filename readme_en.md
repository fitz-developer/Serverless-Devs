**Serverless Devs** is an open source and open serverless developer platform dedicated to providing developers with a powerful tool chain system. Through this platform, developers can not only experience multi cloud serverless products with one click and rapidly deploy serverless projects, but also manage projects in the whole life cycle of serverless applications, and combine serverless devs with other tools / platforms very simply and quickly to further improve the efficiency of R & D, operation and maintenance.

# Project expectations

- Serverless Devs hopes to provide serverless developers with a serverless developer tool that can play a role in the entire life cycle of serverless applications without vendor lock-in;
- Serverless Registry hopes to provide a complete set of package management specifications for the serverless ecosystem, similar to pypi in Python, npm in Nodejs, etc., and will use this to open and share serverless packages and build a serverless ecosystem;
- The Serverless Developer Meetup hopes to create a community event that is most in line with Serverless developers. Through this event, we hope that more people can communicate with us and learn about Serverless-related products;
